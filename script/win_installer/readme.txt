Looking for the Dink files? They are installed to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DinkSmallwoodHD by default.

Supported command line options:

-game <dmod directory> (Example:  dink.exe -game c:\dmods\island ) (this also sets -dmodpath automatically to the dmods parent directory)
-dmodpath or --refdir <dir containing DMOD dirs> (Example:  dink.exe -game c:\dmods )
-debug (turns on extra debug mode options for dmod authors)
-skip (skips version check)
-window (forces windowed mode)

Note:  If a .dmod file is put in the Dink HD directory (where the .exe is) it will be automatically installed and then deleted

To report a bug, find or post a thread about Dink HD on dinknetwork.com and please include the following information if you can:

- Version of the game and which version of Windows/etc you're running on
- Description of the bug and how to recreate it
- If the bug takes work to get to, it would be great if you could "Quick save" in the game and add a URL to download the quicksave.dat file.

quicksave.dat should be located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DinkSmallwoodHD for the main game and %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DinkSmallwoodHD\dmods\<dmod dir> for DMODs.

Tip: If you have any jerkiness/fps issues, try playing with only a single monitor enabled or playing fullscreen (Alt-Enter to toggle)
